# Time of Day Check

## Summary

This workflow is an example of a pipeline that checks to see if the current time is within a specified time window. Depending on the result, the workflow can then fork. This can be used, for example, to ensure that production deployments are limited to specific days of the week and times of the day; to limit notification methods depending on the time of day etc
